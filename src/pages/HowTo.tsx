        <p>Objective</p>
        <p>
          The objective of the game is to draw an animal that includes
          something, however big or small, from each of the 5 category cards.
          There are 5 categories, and a card from each category will be randomly
          selected and flipped when the game begins. The 5 categories are as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p>Small</p>
        <p>
          Small cards feature small animals, from mosquitoes to vampire bats.
        </p>
        <p>Medium</p>
        <p>
          Medium cards feature medium sized animals. Koalas, raccoons, and even
          pteradactyls are in this group.
        </p>
        <p>Large</p>
        <p>
          Large cards feature some of the largest animals on earth. They'll
          range in size from giraffes to blue whales.
        </p>
        <p>Habitat</p>
        <p>
          Habitat cards are the setting for your drawing. When the cards flip,
          you'll have to think about where your animal is in (or out of) this
          world. Habitat cards inlude the beach, a castle, and outter space
        </p>
        <p>Detail</p>
        <p>
          Detail cards feature a specific detail you have to add to your
          drawing. Some require you to use only straight or squiggly lines,
          while others may include specific facial hair or patterns you can draw
          on your animal

        <p>The Game</p>
        <p>
          There are 3 game modes to choose from. Two include a time limit, and
          the third is an open-play, no time-limit mode. When a game mode is
          selected, players are taken to the game page. One of each of the 5
          category cards is displayed and flipped to show the 5 drawing topics.
          If a timed game mode was selected, a timer will display and begin to
          count down. At this point it's time to draw! Use your imagination and
          try to come up with a drawing that includes each of the 5 topic cards.

        Remember, there are millions of ways to win! Each time the cards flip,
        you draw the topics, and when you're finished you win the game! It' that
        simple. There are dozens of animals, habiats, and details for each of
        the category cards. See how many different combinations you can get. We
        bet you'll never get the same drawing twice!
